# ESP32 Servo Motor Control Project

### Project Overview
The ESP32 Servo Motor Control project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an ESP32 microcontroller. Servo motors are widely used for precise angular positioning in robotics, RC vehicles, automation, and various mechanical applications.

### Components Needed
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The main controller that generates control signals for the servo motor.
- **Servo Motor**: A motor with precise control over angular position.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect the servo motor to the ESP32.
- **External Power Supply (if required)**: Provide sufficient power to the servo motor, especially for larger motors.

### Block Diagram

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Servo Motor to ESP32:**
   - **Signal Pin (servoPin)**: Connect the signal pin of the servo motor to GPIO 2 on the ESP32.
   - **Power and Ground**: Connect the power (typically +5V or +3.3V) and ground (GND) of the servo motor to suitable power sources.

### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication for debugging purposes using `Serial.begin(9600)`.
   - Create a `Servo` object and attach it to the GPIO pin defined (`servoPin`).

2. **Operation:**
   - **Sweeping Motion:**
     - Use a `for` loop to sweep the servo motor from 0 to 180 degrees and back.
     - Set the servo position using `myServo.write(angle)` and introduce a small delay (`delay(15)`) to allow the servo to reach each position.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Servo Specifications:** Ensure the power supply and control signals meet the requirements of your specific servo motor.
   - **Timing and Delays:** Adjust the delay values based on the servo motor's response time and movement characteristics.

### Applications
- **Robotics:** Control robotic arm movements and joint rotations.
- **Camera Gimbal:** Stabilize and adjust camera angles remotely.
- **Automation:** Position control in automated systems and mechanisms.
